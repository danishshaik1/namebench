== I get different results each time I run namebench. Why? ==

The first run is the one that is most likely to be accurate. The more times to run namebench, the more likely you are to be repeating the same queries over and over again. This will skew your results toward the closest nameserver to you, rather than the one most likely to have your requests cached during normal operations.

== Are all of the "regional servers" public? == 

__If I do a test run, and it points me at various regional DNS servers, run
by ISPs or transit providers, are these servers officially "public"?__

No. Many regional nameservers are only available to their direct or indirect customers. The ones that do show up on your list are the ones that do allow recursive lookups to your machine however. 

== I run a public nameserver, how do I get added or removed? ==

At the moment, the best way is to open an issue with a list of IP's and names to go along with them.

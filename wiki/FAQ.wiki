== Are all of the "regional servers" public? == 

__If I do a test run, and it points me at various regional DNS servers, run
by ISPs or transit providers, are these servers officially "public"?__

No. Many regional nameservers are only available to their direct or indirect customers. The ones that do show up on your list are the ones that do allow recursive lookups to your machine however. 

== I run a public nameserver, how do I get added or removed? ==

At the moment, the best way is to open an issue with a list of IP's and names to go along with them.
